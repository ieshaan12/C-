# C-
multiply.cpp-
This is a code to multiply any number upto around 1000 digits with 11.
rootfinderxaxbc.cpp-
This code takes 3 arguments from the user a,b,c.
0<= (a,b) <=10
c<0
The motive is to find the root, of this equation. However, I have limited this such that it finds the root only between 0 and 100. I'll try to move beyond this, in sometime.
