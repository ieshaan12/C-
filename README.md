# C-
multiply.cpp-
This is a code to multiply any number upto around 1000 digits with 11.
rootfinderxaxbc.cpp-
This code takes 3 arguments from the user a,b,c.
0<= (a,b) <=10
c<0
The motive is to find the root, of this equation. However, I have limited this such that it finds the root only between 0 and 100. I'll try to move beyond this in sometime.
The current file positiverootfinder has no limitations on a and b anymore, also the root can find the value between 0 to 10^300, however am still working to make it work for negative roots as well as positive c values.
